    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Adnan Jashari, a dedicated Computer Science student who thrives on problem-solving, curiosity, and creativity. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and push myself to learn something new — whether it’s through coding, gaming, or just exploring how things work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of school, I’m all about balance — I love staying active by running, and when I’m chilling, you’ll usually find me watching movies or deep into a CS2 match. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me, especially those that involve logic, design, or teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who can build both the front-end and back-end of real-world applications. I'm not afraid of hard work — I believe in showing up, learning fast, and leveling up every single day.

        <h3>Running</h3>
        <p>Running helps me stay active and clear my mind. I try to go for a run a few times a week — it's my way to reset.</p>
